# 🌳 Day 86 — GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔁 Problem: Boundary Traversal of a Binary Tree
### 🧠 Problem Overview:
Traverse the boundary of a binary tree in an anti-clockwise direction starting from the root, including:

Left boundary (excluding leaves)

Leaf nodes (left to right)

Right boundary (excluding leaves, reversed)

## 💡 Solution Breakdown:
✔️ Three-part traversal:
  1️⃣ addLeftBoundary()
  2️⃣ addLeaves()
  3️⃣ addRightBoundary() (in reverse)

🔍 Helper method isLeaf() used to avoid duplicate insertions
📦 Stored right boundary in a temporary list, reversed before merging

## 🧪 Execution Report:
✅ Test Cases Passed: 1111 / 1111

📈 Accuracy: 100%

⏱️ Time Taken: 0.11 sec

🏅 Points Earned: 4 / 4

🎯 Total Score: 331

## 💬 Code Insight:
“Tree boundaries aren’t limits—they’re just structured perspectives.” 🌿
